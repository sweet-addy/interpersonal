An interpersonal circle is a model of interpersonal interaction which plots every interacting person or every word describing a person on a two-dimensional graph. The Leary Circumplex uses such a graph with the axes represent the dominance and friendliness respectively of each person or word on the graph. Interpersonal uses this graph to compute various results.\n",
